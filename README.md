# Gardening App üå±

A **full stack web application** providing selected vegetable and herb gardening resources.

## Overview

- Originally started as a **React + Redux app**, fetching plant data from external APIs.
- To improve reliability and customization, plant data was curated into a **JSON file** (with the help of AI), manually enriched with images.
- That JSON data was migrated into a **MongoDB database**, forming the foundation of the current application.
- A custom **backend** was then built to access and serve this database to the frontend.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Redux
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Backend Testing**: Vitest
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Render (backend)
- **Data Sources**: AI-assisted JSON enrichment, manually curated images, external API for plant hardiness zone lookup

## Live Demo

- **Frontend (Vercel)**: https://ssalifu-portfolio.vercel.app/
- **Backend API (Render)**: [link-to-backend]

## Features

### Current

- **Search Feature**: Quickly find plants by name.
- **Plant List Display**: Browse a list of vegetable and herb names from the database.
- **Plant Details View**: Each entry includes:
    - Common name & scientific name
    - Planting season and instructions
    - Sunlight requirements
    - Plant hardiness zone
    - Companion planting information

### Planned

- **Filtering**: Display plants by:
    - Planting season
    - Type (vegetable vs. herb)
    - Sunlight requirement
    - Indoor start vs. direct seeding
- **Planting & Harvest Calculator**: Calculate planting and harvesting times based on location and season.
- **Ornamental Plants Section**: A separate database collection and page for non-edible plants.

## Database Notes

- The full production dataset is **not included in this repository**.
- This is intentional because:
    - Additional data cleaning is necessary.
    - The data (excluding manually enriched images) was AI-generated and may contain errors or inconsistencies.
- For local testing, you may use a small **demo dataset** (see below).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB instance)

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
    
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/yourusername/gardening-app.git>
    cd gardening-app
    
    ```
    
2. **Install dependencies**

npm install

1. **Environment setup**
Create a .env file in the backend folder with:

MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
PORT=5050

1. **Seed data**

‚ö†Ô∏è The full dataset used in production is private.

To test locally, upload the samplePlantData.json file in the server/database folder to your own MongoDB database.

1. **Run frontend and backend concurrently**
From the root folder:

npm run dev

This will start:

- React frontend on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
- Express backend on [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050/)
1. **Deployment**

Frontend: Deployed to Vercel by connecting the frontend folder and configuring build settings (npm run build).

Backend: Deployed to Render with environment variables set in the dashboard (MONGODB_URI, PORT).
